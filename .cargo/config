# Note: we cannot forego linking against OpenMP when it's disabled, because
# cfg(feature = "...") is ignored in this file. If there is ever a way to
# specify -fopenmp in the build script, it could be optionally emitted there
# since features are resolved by the time the buidl script runs. However
# cargo:rustc-flags only allows options that start with -l, and the more
# general cargo:rustc-cfg chokes on ["-C", "link-args=-fopenmp"].
